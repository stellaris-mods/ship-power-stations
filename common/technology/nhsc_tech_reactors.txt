# NHunters Extra Ship Components Fake Techs

# Since (1) we load _after_ the mod above if it's
# installed, AND (2) we use the _same filename_ for
# the techs, their file will take precedence, and
# this file will simply never load.
#
# If the mod above is _not_ installed, this file
# allows our components to depend on these technologies
# and (a) produce no error log output, and (b) never
# show up ingame.
