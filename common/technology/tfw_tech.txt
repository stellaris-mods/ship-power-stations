# TFWs Bunch of Ship Parts Fake Techs

# Since (1) we load _before_ the mod above if it's installed,
# AND (2) we use a _different file name_ for the techs,
# the mod aboves techs will _overwrite_ these fake ones.
#
# What also needs to be true is that this file needs to load
# _before_ the original in natural sort order by filename.
# Which it does. TFWs file is "tfw_techs_reactors.txt", which means
# it loads after.
#
# If the mod above is _not_ installed, this file
# allows our components to depend on these technologies
# and (a) produce no error log output, and (b) never
# show up ingame.
