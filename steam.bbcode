[h1][b]Adds hard-mounted power stations to all military ships[/b][/h1]
It never made much sense to me that the ships didn't have built-in power plants!
So this mod adds a fixed power station mount to all military-class hulls, including the military stations :-)

[b]I do not read comments or forums on Steam any more. I can only be reached on Github.[/b]

[h1]Mod details[/h1]
The power station mount can be equipped with predefined reactors for every standard (vanilla) tech, from Fission to Zero Point (and the new secret one!).

Power Stations generate ~50% of total hull utility slot capacity, so they free up lots of slots for other parts :-)
Mineral cost remains identical to slot-based reactors.

[b]The AI uses the power stations.[/b]
Any non-standard country does not, however. This includes Fallen Empires, Unbidden, Swarm, Awakened, Guardians, Drones, Pirates, Clouds, Wraiths, and everything else where the designs of their ships is predetermined.
However, these countries get significant buffs to a wide array of ship properties if you simply select Hard/Insane difficulty.

[b][i]This mod does not remove any utility slots. You can still use power reactors in utility slots as before.[/i][/b]

[h1]Compatibility[/h1]
Incompatible with anything that changes the default ships. Because Paradox.
I've seen several mods on the workshop that replace vanilla files for no good reason, and also one that actually included all files from Stellaris, thus replacing the whole game! So, please be careful :-)

Compatible with Crystallis Ship Modules.

It is compatible with existing save games, but you need to research something (anything, research any technology) before you get access to previous power station levels.
After that, you get access to higher power station levels along with the core reactor research options.

Please, before you comment with any bug reports, realise that this addon is in fact extremely simple. The only thing it adds is a component.
If you have a problem, it is most likely caused by some other addon.
Or, you're using more than one addon that overwrites 00_ship_sizes.txt.

[h1]Replaced files[/h1]
The mod replaces the following game files:
common/ship_sizes/00_ship_sizes.txt
